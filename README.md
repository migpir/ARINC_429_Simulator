# ARINC_429_Simulator
This simulator accepts a csv file with ARINC 429 labels and generates an ARINC waveform via openGL.  The csv file is populated with ARINC data such as desired ARINC lable, SSM value, data, parity and frame rate.

The simulator will read each row from the csv file, process it and then generate a plot of what the ARINC data looks like if seen on an oscilloscope.
